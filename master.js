	 * 		- find a decent target (until formulas is aquired)
	 * 		- update the target with a formula after formulas is aquired (check if its available?)
	 * 		- find usable servers (do they need a backdoor?)
	 * 		- calculate hack, grow and weaken threads and divide them over usable servers
	 * 		- occasionally update target and usable servers (15 min?)
